This is shithead. It does bulk whois lookups. It needs a version of PyWhois; either my fork [https://github.com/emf/pywhois] or the google version. whatever.

you also need a socks proxy of some kind.  It doesn't matter, as long as it speaks socks.  This can be Tor, if you want to irritate the tor network and generally
be a dick; or it can be a botnet of somekind, i guess, which means you're a special kind of dick, or you can rip out the socks logic (couple of lines) and
get about 12 queries in before all the whois servers in the world ban your IP for a terms-of-service violation.   See, bulk whois is apparently only used by
spammers and miscreants, otherwise you have to spend umpty-thousands of dollars to get a legitimate feed of this data.

You're on your own. Don't run this tool. Don't be a dick.

anyway, it takes a flatfile "domains.txt" of dns names.  it emits whois records in the simplest sqlite db you've ever seen.

socks.py is http://socksipy.sourceforge.net/ by Dan Haim; not me. it just works great.
